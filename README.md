## Deadnet
This is a social deduction game similar to famous titles like among us or the mafia card game. The game is a type of social deduction games where users must use their reasoning and deduction skills in voting out who the AI is. 

## About the Project
Setting the scene in the future 50 years from now, we created a what if situation regarding the Dead Net Theory(Citations Here). Assuming the continuos improvement of AI and Automation can spell the doom of humanities. We intend by developing this fun social deduction game we can start educating users how AI think and allow them to distinguish AI from Humans. By also having other human players participate we can replicate a more realistic scenario if ever an AI tries to disguise as a human.
